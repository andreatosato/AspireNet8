# .NET Aspire dapr sample app

This is a simple .NET app that shows how to use Dapr with .NET Aspire orchestration.

## Demonstrates

- How to configure a .NET Aspire app to work with Dapr

## Sample prerequisites

Dapr installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/). After installing the Dapr CLI, remember to run `dapr init` as described [here](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/).

This sample is written in C# and targets .NET 8.0. It requires the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later.

## Building the sample

To download and run the sample, follow these steps:

1. Download and unzip the sample.
2. In Visual Studio (2022 or later):
    1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **Open** > **Project/Solution**.
    2. Navigate to the folder that holds the unzipped sample code, and open the solution (.sln) file.
    3. Right click the _AspireWithDapr.AppHost_ project in the solution explore and choose it as the startup project.
    4. Choose the <kbd>F5</kbd> key to run with debugging, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> keys to run the project without debugging.
3. From the command line:
   1. Navigate to the folder that holds the unzipped sample code.
   2. At the command line, type [`dotnet run`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run).

To run the game, run the .NET Aspire app by executing the following at the command prompt (opened to the base directory of the sample):

``` bash
dotnet run --project AspireWithDapr.AppHost
```

1. On the **Projects** page, click on one of the endpoints for the listed project. This launches the simple .NET app.
